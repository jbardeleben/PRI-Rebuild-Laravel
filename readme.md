# PRI-Rebuild-Laravel
Description of this project and a little history as to why it exists

# What Is This and Why
This is a rebuild of the Phoenix Revolution, Inc. website (www.phoenixrevolutioninc.com - current website is not built with this framework) using the PHP Laravel [5.2] Framework (I really wanted to learn this framework and as I continue to use it I have really come to like it a lot, especially it's ease of use and superb documentation), started based on the video tutorial series by Alex Curtis (http://jacurtis.com or search DevMarketer on YouTube).

This originally started off as a fake blog site that was built using the PHP framework Laravel, version 5.2, for educational purposes on my free time. As I went through the tutorials (by Alex Curtix - http://jacurtis.com), I decided that I was going to slowly start integrating material from a website I already had so I could use this as something more practical other than just an educational exploration. Then shortly after I began this series, I was asked about rebuilding the Phoenix Revolution website, and part of that site included a blogging/articles platform ... Perfect! So I started a new Laravel app and created this. There are still some of my other random files in here from the tutorial series that I have not fully removed yet, but they will be phased out as I move along.

So, long story short, this will be the initial commit because this site will be hosted on shared hosting (not my decision unfortunately) and from my research, it's going to be a lot easier to do it (upload to and function correctly) from a github account.

# Feel Free to Help!
If anyone wants to help me make this a bad ass site, let me know, I have a list of features I want (some are a need) to add but for now, as I am the lone developer on this and it's on my "free" time, there will be changes probably made in bursts of frequency. Don't hesitate to shoot me an email (jay@wavlite.com) if interested.

Cheers!

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
